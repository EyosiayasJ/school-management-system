3. Implement proper loading states in components
4. Follow the service method naming conventions

5. Add the export to the barrel file

## ðŸ”„ Example Usage

```javascript
import { studentService, teacherService } from '@/services/domains';

async function loadDashboardData() {
  const [students, teachers] = await Promise.all([
    studentService.getStudents({ status: 'active' }),
    teacherService.getTeachers({ branch: 'Main Campus' })
  ]);
  
  return { students, teachers };
}
