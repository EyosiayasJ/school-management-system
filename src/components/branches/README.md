# Branch Components

This directory contains React components for managing and displaying branch-related information in the School Management System frontend.

## Components
- **ViewBranchModal.jsx**: Modal for displaying detailed branch information in a consistent, modern card layout matching the student and teacher profile modals.

## Design & UX
- All modals use a unified card style with a blue header, avatar/icon, status badge, and an Indian Red close button in the top-right corner.
- Layout, padding, and structure are consistent with the `students` and `teachers` component directories.

## Usage
Import and use these components in branch management pages or wherever branch details need to be displayed or edited.

```
import ViewBranchModal from './ViewBranchModal';
```

## Conventions
- Follow the same naming and style conventions as in the `students` and `teachers` directories.
- Keep UI/UX consistent across all entity modals for a seamless user experience.
