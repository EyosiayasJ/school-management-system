## 🎨 Asset Usage Guidelines

When using assets, follow these best practices:
1. **Import Directly** - Use ES import syntax for webpack optimization
2. **Size Appropriately** - Set dimensions based on usage context
3. **Lazy Load** - For large assets, use lazy loading techniques
4. **Alt Text** - Always provide descriptive alt text for accessibility

## 📁 Asset Organization

Assets are categorized by:
- Type (images, icons, fonts)
- Usage (branding, UI elements, illustrations)
- Feature area (when specific to a feature)

## 🔄 Adding New Assets

1. Use optimized file formats (SVG for vector, WebP for photos)
2. Keep file sizes as small as possible
3. Name files consistently with kebab-case
4. Document usage in this README
5. Consider licensing and attribution requirements

## 🎭 Image Optimization

All production assets should be optimized for:
- File size reduction
- Fast loading
