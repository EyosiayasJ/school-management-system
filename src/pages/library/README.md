# E-Library Module

## Overview
The E-Library module provides a digital library system for schools to manage and distribute educational resources to students and teachers. It features a responsive UI with search, filtering, pagination, and detailed resource views.

## Features
- **Resource Browsing**: Grid-based view of all library resources with responsive layout
- **Search & Filtering**: Real-time search with debouncing and category filtering
- **Resource Details**: Modal view showing comprehensive resource information
- **Pagination**: Client-side pagination for better performance
- **Add Resources**: Modal form for adding new resources to the library
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach that works on all device sizes
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and proper focus management
- **Local Storage**: Persistence of library resources between sessions

## Components
- **ELibrary**: Main container component for the library module
- **ResourceCard**: Reusable card component for displaying resource previews
- **ResourceDetailModal**: Modal component for viewing detailed resource information
- **AddResourceModal**: Form modal for adding new resources

## Data Structure
Each resource contains the following properties:
```javascript
{
  id: Number,
  title: String,
  author: String,
  category: String,
  format: String,
  thumbnail: String,
  description: String,
  publishedDate: String, // ISO format date
  pages: Number,
  isbn: String
}
```

## API Integration
The module is designed to be easily connected to a backend API:
- All data operations are abstracted through the `api/library.js` service
- Currently uses local storage with mock data fallback
- Ready for replacement with real API endpoints

## Future Enhancements
- **Server-side pagination**: Replace client-side pagination with API-based pagination
- **Advanced filtering**: Add more filter options (date range, format, etc.)
- **Resource ratings**: Allow users to rate and review resources
- **Favorites system**: Enable users to save favorites and create reading lists
- **Download tracking**: Track and report on resource downloads
- **Resource preview**: Implement in-app preview for supported formats
- **Resource recommendations**: Suggest related resources based on user activity

## Usage Guidelines
- Use the ResourceCard component for consistent display of resources
- Maintain accessibility by including proper ARIA attributes
- Follow the established data structure when adding new resources
- Use the storage utility functions for consistent data persistence
