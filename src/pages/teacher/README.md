## ðŸ”„ Data Flow

Each page typically follows this data flow pattern:
1. Fetch data using API services or mock data
2. Display loading states while data is being fetched
3. Handle and display any errors that occur
4. Present the data in an organized, user-friendly interface
5. Provide actions to interact with the data
6. Submit changes back to the API when needed
