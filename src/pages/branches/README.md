# Branch Management Pages

This directory contains page-level components for managing and displaying branches in the School Management System frontend.

## Main File(s)
- **BranchManagement.jsx**: The main page for listing, searching, filtering, and editing school branches. Integrates with branch modals and handles all UI logic for branch operations.

## Features
- Displays a searchable and filterable list of branches.
- Allows adding, editing, and viewing branch details using consistent modal components.
- Shows branch statistics (total branches, students, teachers).
- Uses the same design language as the student and teacher management pages for a unified user experience.

## Conventions
- Follows the same React and UI/UX conventions as the `students` and `teachers` page directories.
- All modals and detail views are consistent in style, layout, and accessibility.
